# MovieLens-Machine-Learning-With-R-
The MovieLens dataset was originally collected by GroupLens Research, a research team located in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. The dataset was collected in order to obtain research data on personal movie recommendations. There are 9000055 rows, and 6 columns in the MovieLens dataset. In the edx dataset, there are 10677 movies, with a total of 69878 users. The goal of the project was to compare four supervised machine learning models - one that uses just the mean, one that uses the movie effect, one that uses the movie effect (regularized), and one that uses both the movie and user effect (regularized) - to see which model has the lowest root mean square error (RSME).
