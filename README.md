# MovieLens-Machine-Learning-With-R

Final project of the HarvardX Professional Certificate in Data Science (completed September 2019).

## Introduction
The MovieLens dataset was originally collected by GroupLens Research, a research team located in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota. 

## Dataset
The dataset was collected in order to obtain research data on personal movie recommendations. There are 9000055 rows, and 6 columns in the MovieLens dataset. In the edx dataset, there are 10677 movies, with a total of 69878 users. 

## Objective
The goal of the project was to compare four supervised machine learning models - one that uses just the mean, one that uses the movie effect, one that uses the movie effect (regularized), and one that uses both the movie and user effect (regularized) - to see which model has the lowest root mean square error (RSME).

## Methods
Here are the key steps that were performed in order of completion: package installation and library loading, downloading the data, creating the dataset, creating the validation set, Dataset exploration and visualization, creating the predictive model, mean method, movie effect method, movie effect – regularized, movie and user effects – regularized

## Results
The movie and user effect (regularized) model proved to have the lowest RSME (0.8646166).
